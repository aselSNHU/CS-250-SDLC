**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
To interpret user needs, gather feedback from stakeholders and translate it into clear requirements. "User stories" break down these needs into actionable tasks, focusing on the user's perspective and ensuring alignment with their goals.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
I approach development by understanding the problem, breaking it into smaller tasks, and building incrementally. I plan to use Agile processes like Scrum for sprint management and Kanban for visualizing workflow, promoting collaboration and continuous improvement.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
A good team member collaborates, communicates openly, and is receptive to feedback. They contribute ideas, help others, and adapt to changing needs while ensuring clear communication and alignment with project goals.
